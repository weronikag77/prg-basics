HEALTHY LIFESTYLE

I decided to start jogging every morning to get fit,
but my body seems to have other plans. The moment
my alarm rings, my legs pretend they’re glued to the bed.
It’s like my brain says, "Time to run!" but the rest
of my body hears, "Time to hit snooze... again."
Honestly, I think my bed is holding me hostage.

And don’t get me started on my fridge’s new habit of judging
my diet choices. Every time I open it, the vegetables
sit there looking all fresh and healthy, while the leftover
pizza screams, "Pick me!" It’s like having an ongoing battle
between my good intentions and my cravings. If only the fridge
came with a motivational speaker setting, I might actually
choose the salad... someday.
