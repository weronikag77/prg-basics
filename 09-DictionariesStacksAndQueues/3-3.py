#Define a function that returns true if the brackets (), {}, [] are used correctly 
# in the given expression. Otherwise, the function returns false. 
# Then write a program that checks the correctness of the expressions given below.

#Use a stack. Read the next characters of the expression. Skip all but the brackets. 
# If it is an opening bracket, put it on the stack. If it is a closing bracket, get the item from the stack and compare whether it is a matching opening bracket.
